<h2><b> What are the symptoms of COVID-19? </b></h2>

<p style="margin-right: 450px; text-align: justify;"><h3><ul>
<li>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness.</li>
<li>Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell or a rash on skin or discoloration of fingers or toes.</li>
<li>These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. </li>
<li>Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment.</li>
<li>Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness.</li>
<li>However, anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill.  People of all ages who experience fever and/or  cough associated withdifficulty breathing/shortness of breath, chest pain/pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical attention immediately.</li></ul></h3></p>

<h2><b> How long does it take after exposure to COVID-19 to develop symptoms? </b></h2>

<p style="margin-right: 450px; text-align: justify;"><h3><ul>
<li>The time between exposure to COVID-19 and the moment when symptoms start is commonly around five to six days but can range from 1 â€“ 14 days.</li></ul></h3></p>

<h2><b> Can COVID-19 be caught form a person who has no symptoms? </b></h2>

<p style="margin-right: 450px; text-align: justify;"><h3><ul>
<li>COVID-19 is mainly spread through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing or has other symptoms such as fever or tiredness.</li>
<li>Many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true in the early stages of the disease.</li>
<li>It is possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has just a mild cough and does not feel ill.</li>
<li>Some reports have indicated that people with no symptoms can transmit the virus.</li>
<li>It is not yet known how often it happens.</li></ul></h3></p>
