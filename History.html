		<li>Two novel strains B814 and 229E were subsequently imaged by electron microscopy in 1967 by Scottish virologist June Almeida in London.</li>
		<li>This new group of IBV-like viruses which were shown to be morphologically related to the mouse hepatitis virus, came to be known as coronaviruses.</li>
		<li>Other human coronaviruses have since been identified, including SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV HKU1 in 2005, MERS-CoV in 2012.</li>
		<li>There have also been a large number of animal coronaviruses identified since the 1960s.</li>
