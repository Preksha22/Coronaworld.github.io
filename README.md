# Website on Corona theme.

I made this website completely from scratch in 2 days, using only HTML and CSS code.

No templates are used. 

In this website, Statistics.html is a dynamic page which is connected to a live Google Sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1POc9kIkNipxQpw3pyHcXcE_GSKAyVYWCiIWbJb08D-I/edit?usp=sharing), and hence would get updated automatically to the recent data regarding corona cases in India.
